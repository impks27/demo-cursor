Here is a clean, practical evaluation checklist you can use for your Cursor IDE PoC, along with dummy project setup ideas so you can reach a clear conclusion on its capabilities.


---

✅ Cursor IDE Evaluation Checklist (PoC)

A structured list of activities you should perform to validate Cursor’s strengths across AI coding, refactoring, debugging, repo understanding, workflow acceleration, and integrations.


---

1. Setup & Project Understanding

✔️ Activities

Import an existing repo (small + medium size)

Check how well Cursor understands project structure

Use “Ask Cursor” to explain:

Folder structure

Tech stack

Code flow

Dependencies



✔️ Expected Capability

Cursor should give accurate summaries and cross-file reasoning.


✔️ Dummy Repo to Use

A small Node.js + Express API

A medium Python project with 10–20 files (e.g., text classifier project)



---

2. Code Generation (From Scratch)

✔️ Activities

Ask Cursor to scaffold a new feature/module

Generate CRUD APIs

Generate React components

Generate Terraform IaC

Ask it to write unit tests


✔️ Expected Capability

Cursor should write multi-file code and auto-create files with correct imports.


✔️ Dummy Tasks

“Create a User Auth module in Node.js with JWT.”

“Create a Terraform script to deploy an S3 bucket with versioning.”

“Create a React form component with validation.”



---

3. Code Editing (Magic + Precise Edits)

✔️ Activities

Use Magic Fix on errors

Use @commands to refactor:

rename variables

extract class

convert JS → TS

break a big file into smaller files


Multi-file refactor using AI Diff


✔️ Expected Capability

Cursor should show diffs clearly+ perform large refactors consistently.


✔️ Dummy Tasks

“Rewrite this entire module to TypeScript.”

“Split this 300-line function into separate files.”

“Optimize this Python loop (10k records).”



---

4. Repository-Level Reasoning

✔️ Activities

Ask Cursor to find:

dead code

security issues

unused packages

performance bottlenecks


Ask it to map:

API endpoint → controller → service → db file flow



✔️ Expected Capability

Cursor should handle multi-file queries gracefully.


✔️ Dummy Tasks

“Find all APIs where input validation is missing.”

“Locate duplicate logic in this repo.”

“Explain the full execution flow of POST /login.”



---

5. Debugging & Error Fixing

✔️ Activities

Paste logs or error messages

Ask Cursor to fix:

runtime errors

TypeScript compile errors

circular imports

NPM dependency conflicts



✔️ Expected Capability

Cursor should give precise diffs and runnable fixes.


✔️ Dummy Tasks

Break the project on purpose: remove an import.

Introduce a typo.

Add conflicting package versions.



---

6. AI-Accelerated Workflow

✔️ Activities

Try multi-cursor AI chat

Ask Cursor to:

create a PR

write commit messages

summarize PRs

document functions

generate README



✔️ Expected Capability

Cursor should improve dev speed noticeably.


✔️ Dummy Tasks

“Generate documentation for the service layer.”

“Summarize changes across all files in this branch.”



---

7. Integration Testing

✔️ Activities

Connect Cursor with:

GitHub

CI tool (GitHub Actions)

Linting + formatting tools



✔️ Expected Capability

Smooth PR workflows and inline suggestions.


✔️ Dummy Tasks

“Create a GitHub Action for Node.js CI.”

“Fix ESLint violations across repo.”



---

8. Local vs Cloud Model Evaluation

✔️ Activities

Test with OpenAI models

Test with local LLM (Ollama)

Compare:

speed

context quality

coding accuracy



✔️ Dummy Tasks

Generate the same feature using:

GPT-4.1

Local model (e.g., CodeQwen or DeepSeek)




---

9. Team Collaboration

✔️ Activities

Share branches

Review code generated by Cursor

Validate reproducibility of results across team members


✔️ Expected Capability

Consistent multi-dev experience.



---

⭐ Recommended Dummy Dataset/Projects for Your PoC

Use two repos:


---

A. Small Project (Beginner-Level)

nodejs-api-poc/

Node.js + Express

3–5 routes

Mongo or SQLite

JWT Auth

Simple CRUD



---

B. Medium Project (Complex)

text-classifier-poc/

Python

FastAPI

Embeddings + Classifier

PDF/EML parsing scripts

10–20 files

Shared modules/imports

Unit tests missing (for Cursor to generate)
